# SDWebImageDemo

In this demo, I have covered image caching and asynchronous image fetching in Swift using SDWebImage Pod. Created a simple project in Xcode through Storyboard, then hit the famous Dog API endpoint, which contains lots of images.

When dealing with a lot of images, they should be loaded asynchronously and not block the main website or mobile app. These images should also be cached so that the mobile app can load them faster next time.
